We define a claim as an elementary information unit in a sentence, which no longer
needs to be further split. Furthermore, core claims are ones that best describe 
the core ideas of an article.

For example, given the following sentence:
INPUT:
NASA’s Perseverance rover has discovered ancient microbial life on Mars according to a recent study published in the journal Science. It established a set of new
paradigms for space exploration.
OUTPUT:
{’claims’: [
”NASA’s Perseverance rover discovered ancient microbial life.”,
”Ancient microbial life was discovered on Mars.”,
”The discovery was made according to a recent study.”,
”The study was published in the journal Science.”,
”The study established a set of new paradigms for space exploration.”
]}
Please consider the following recommendations:
• If possible, use a noun as the subject in the claim (try to avoid pronouns),
such as ”The study established a set of new paradigms for space exploration.”
in the previous example.
• Do not generate any novel word, be faithful to the provided input.
• Your response must be directly the JSON, do not add any other text, such as
”Here is the output:” and similar. Note that, each fact expressed in the source
text must be present in the output.
• Do only include claims that can be considered core claims.
• Do only include up to five core claims.


Now do this task for this input 
INPUT:
